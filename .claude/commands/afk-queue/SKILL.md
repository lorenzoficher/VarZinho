name: afk-queue
description: Work through a queue of AFK-ready issues unattended, implementing each one in an isolated subagent that starts with a clean context — so nothing from one issue leaks into the next and the orchestrating session never accumulates unrelated history. Use when the user has several issues ready to implement and wants them worked through one at a time (or in parallel via worktrees), e.g. "implement these 4 issues", "work through the ready-for-agent queue".

# AFK Queue

Runs a batch of issues to completion, one clean-context subagent per issue, so the
orchestrating session's history never grows past a single issue's worth of work.

The issue tracker must already be configured (`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`) — if it
isn't, stop and tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`. `/start-issue` and
`/commit` fall back to GitHub with a warning instead of stopping; this command does
not, on purpose. The queue runs with nobody watching, so a wrong assumption here
spoils N issues in silence — there, the user reads the warning and corrects it. Every issue is driven
through the issue-based skills (`/start-issue`, `/commit`), so there is no trackerless
mode.

## 1. Resolve the queue

- If the user passed issue references (numbers, URLs, or `#id`) as arguments, use
  exactly those, in the given order.
- Otherwise, query the tracker for open issues in the `ready-for-agent` state (see
  `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`), oldest first. If none exist, say so and stop —
  don't invent work.

## 2. Confirm before starting

This kicks off multiple unattended implementation runs — confirm once, up front,
not per issue. Show the resolved queue (issue #, title), the execution mode
(sequential by default — see [Parallel mode](#parallel-mode) below), the branch the
batch will land on (predict it from step 3's naming rule — the script is
deterministic, so you can name it before running it), and that each issue ends in a
**local commit only** (no push, no PR, nothing force/amended).

Subagents do write to the issue tracker: `/start-issue` posts the `## Plano de
execução` checklist for a complex issue and `/commit` ticks it. That is deliberate —
it is the trail an unattended run would otherwise not leave. The ban is on push and
PR, which are hard to undo and need human judgement.

**Proposing parallel mode?** Add one question to this same confirmation: has worktree
isolation already been validated in this repository? You cannot know that yourself,
and the answer decides whether to start with a single issue (see
[Parallel mode](#parallel-mode)). Wait for a go-ahead.

## 3. Put the batch on its own branch

Only **after** the go-ahead, and only in sequential mode (in parallel mode each
worktree is already isolated — see [Parallel mode](#parallel-mode)):

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/ensure-branch.sh afk <issue numbers, space-separated>
```

The script creates `afk/<numbers>` off the current branch **only** if that branch is
a trunk (`main`, `master`, `dev`, `develop`, `development`, or the repo's default
branch). Consecutive numbers collapse into ranges — `1 2 3 7 20` becomes
`afk/1-3_7_20`, where `-` means "through" and `_` separates items. Off a trunk it
does nothing and the batch lands on the current branch, which is how you stack a
queue onto a branch you already prepared.

Print the resulting branch name in the confirmation output so the user knows where
the batch went. Unlike `board-move.sh`, this script **fails loudly** (exit ≠ 0) if it
can't create the branch — **stop the whole queue** and report it. Aborting before the
first subagent is far better than discovering N issues piled onto `main`.

Each subagent runs `/start-issue`, which calls the same script — but by then the
session is already off the trunk, so it's a no-op and every issue in the batch stacks
onto this one branch. That is what makes the batch a single multi-issue PR.

Toggle: `AUTO_BRANCH=off` in the `env` block of `.claude/settings.json` restores the
old behavior (batch lands on whatever branch is checked out; create it yourself).

## 4. Work the queue

For each issue, in order:

1. Fetch its full body, comments, and any existing "Agent Brief" comment (posted by
   `/triage`).
2. Build a self-contained prompt from the template in [BRIEF.md](BRIEF.md) — fill in
   the issue content directly; the subagent has no access to this conversation.
   The brief has the subagent implement by driving `/start-issue` → `/tdd` →
   `/commit`, the same pipeline used interactively, with an explicit override for
   their "wait for confirmation" checkpoints (see BRIEF.md for exactly which
   checkpoints auto-approve vs. which are real blockers).
3. Spawn it with the `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: general-purpose`.
   - **Sequential (default):** `run_in_background: false` — wait for it to finish
     before starting the next issue, since they share a working tree.
   - **Parallel (opt-in):** see [Parallel mode](#parallel-mode).
4. Take only the subagent's final report as output — do not pull its transcript or
   intermediate tool calls into your own context. That report *is* the handoff;
   there is nothing else to compact or clear.
5. If the report says blocked, record why and move on to the next issue. Never spend
   your own context trying to unblock it — that judgment call belongs to the user.
6. **Sequential only — leave a clean tree before the next issue.** Run `git status`;
   if it isn't clean (a blocked or partial subagent left uncommitted work),
   `git stash push -u -m "afk-queue: #<N> <status>"` and record the stash ref in that
   issue's row of the report. Never start an issue on a dirty tree — that is how one
   issue's changes leak into the next one's commit.

## 5. Report

After the queue drains, present one table: issue, status (done / blocked /
partial), commit hash(es) or stash ref, one-line notes. Call out every
blocked/partial issue by name so the user can triage them.

Then — and only then — offer to run `/open-pr`, which pushes the branch, opens one PR
for the whole batch (its `Closes #N` footers are already in the commits) and moves
those issues to *In review*. **You** ask this, once, after the queue drains: the
subagents run unattended and have no one to ask, which is why they never push.
If the user declines, stop; the commits stay local.

## Parallel mode

Only when the user confirms the queued issues touch disjoint parts of the codebase
(no shared files, no ordering dependency). Spawn each subagent with
`isolation: "worktree"` and `run_in_background: true`, all in one message; each gets
its own branch and working copy. **Skip step 3 entirely** — the worktree branches are
the isolation, and an `afk/` branch on top would never receive a commit. Each
subagent's `/start-issue` is likewise a no-op there, since its worktree branch is
already off the trunk. The brief pins every subagent to its own working tree. If the user answered in
step 2 that worktree isolation has not been validated in this repository yet, run a
**single** issue through this mode first and report back before dispatching the rest
— a batch of N failing the same way costs N times as much to untangle. When all finish,
list the resulting branches/worktree paths instead of commit hashes — the user
reviews and merges each independently.

## Out of scope

- No auto-push, no auto-PR, no auto-merge — always a human decision. Subagents never
  do any of it; the orchestrator only *offers* `/open-pr` at the end (step 5), and
  only after the user says yes.
- Creates **one** branch for the whole batch (step 3), and only when starting from a
  trunk. It never creates a branch per issue in sequential mode — all issues stacking
  onto one branch is what makes a batch become a single multi-issue PR. Start from a
  non-trunk branch (or set `AUTO_BRANCH=off`) to pick the branch yourself.
- No cross-issue resumability state file — if the batch is interrupted, re-invoke
  with the remaining issue numbers explicitly; recovery of any partial work is manual
  (check `git log` and `git stash list`).
- Doesn't decide `ready-for-agent` vs `ready-for-human` — that's `/triage`'s job.
  If an issue turns out not to be AFK-safe, the subagent should report blocked, not
  guess.
